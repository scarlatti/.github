# Scarlatti Foundation

The Scarlatti Foundation's goal is the preservation and dissemination of the works of Domenico Scarlatti, and in particular of his keyboard sonatas.

This GitHub organization contains:
- high-quality digitizations of the contemporary sources for Scarlatti's work;
- high-quality datasets related to Scarlatti.

The foundation's initial support was provided by Princeton University and is supported by on-going grants.

Contact Dr. Jérémie Lumbroso <lumbroso@cs.princeton.edu> for more information.
